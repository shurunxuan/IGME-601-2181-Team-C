# Drone Stealth Market & User Analysis

The game we are going to make is a stealth game which player controls a drone to sneak into enemies' facility.

## The target market and user(s) for your game

Since this game will be a 3D pure stealth game with drones, so the target audience will be:

 - People who like stealth games.
 - Drone enthusiasts.
 - People who like to explore the level.

### People who like stealth games

In a stealth game, players usually plan their route of sneaking in, analyze their surroundings and respond to some unexpected situations quickly. So, our target players will be fans of stealth games, and they are obsessed with planning things, sticking to the plan and being vigilant to the environment and enemies. They want to gain a sense of achievement from sneaking, blending in, avoiding enemies, and completing their goals unseen.

We want to provide such an experience to our target and potential audience. We want to make the missions in our game challenging. This means that the player needs a thorough plan to infiltrate enemy base. The player may also need some maneuverability to pass through some parts of the level. 

### Drone enthusiasts

Since the player is going to control a drone, we believe that drone enthusiasts are also our target audience. 

Drone enthusiasts include people who are interested in flying a drone in an open space and those who are dedicated to modifying the functions and performance of the drone.

We want our game to attract both kinds of people. So, we are looking into the non-linear level design. We also want our level to have vertical complexity. In this way, we think those who like flying the drone can enjoy the experience of flying around. Also, we plan to introduce customizations of drones into the game. Players can install different tools on the drone to do a variety of things. 

### People who like to explore the level

There are many open-world games on the market nowadays, and many players are attracted by them because these players like to explore the world. We would like to target at these players too, so we want to make our levels non-linear since we don't have enough time to make an open-world game.

## The history of and current emerging trends in this market

### Stealth game

The ancestor of stealth games is generally considered to be _Metal Gear_ (1987, Konami). Before this game, there were several games with some stealth elements like patrolling guards and assassination. _Metal Gear_ introduced silenced firearms and noise detection. The enemy will also call for help if they are alerted. _Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake_ (1990, Konami) introduced crouching and radar system. 

Since then, stealth games become a genre. These games started to pursue a more realistic stealth experience. In the game _Thief: The Dark Project_ (1998, Eidos Interactive), players can hide in shadows. In _Splinter Cell_ (2002, Ubisoft), players can peek under doors. _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ introduced a robust camouflage and disguise system. 

Recent stealth games emphasize more on giving players multiple options. _Dishonored_ (2012, Bethesda) directly told players that they can choose their own play style in the tutorial. _Thief_ (2014, Square Enix) gives players room to decide how to sneak in and out. Players have options to go through the vents, the basement, and the roof to complete their tasks. _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_ (2015, Konami) has a great open world, in which players can get to a vantage point, recon the area and plan carefully before the infiltration start.

### Games with drones

Those games with drones are rare in the market. Some indie games give players experience of controlling drones to race or shoot at each other. In some AAA games like _Rainbow Six: Siege_ (2016, Ubisoft) and _Ghost Recon: Wildlands_ (2017, Ubisoft), players can use drones to mark enemies, which is mostly the main function of drones. 

## The niche in this market that your game will fill

Our game aims at giving players the experience of flying drones as well as sneaking into enemy's facilities. 

As drone games in the market are rare, our game can directly fill the niche. Even in games with drones, their main function is just marking enemies. Instead of that, we want our drone to do more things like hacking into computers, flying through detecting measurements, and taking pictures.  

We also want to fill the gap in stealth games. In almost all stealth games, players control human beings to complete missions. Thus, the designs of these games mainly focus on the terrain. But with a flying drone, we can have more possibilities. We want our levels to have more vertical complexity, which will give players a new experience of sneaking in. 

## Any specific characteristics of the users that will influence your game design

Some players always make a thorough plan before playing the game. For these players, we want to have a blueprint system. The player can have a look at the blueprint of the building they will infiltrate, and make a plan based on it before they start their operation. 

There are also players who like customizations. In our game, the player will have the choice to decide which tool they want to install on the drone. With these customizations, the players can build unique drones and find a most suitable way to achieve the goals.
