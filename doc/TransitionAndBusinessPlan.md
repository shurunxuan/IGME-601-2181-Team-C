# PROJECT Transition and Business Plan

## Project Readiness for Production
Current prototype demonstrates a solid gameplay that is mostly functional. However, most of the functionallity and content is still rough and could use refinement or replacement. Our next steps should be to consider refactoring and changes to exist controls and mechanics while simmultaneously moving forward in areas we have overlooked up until this time.

## Known Risks
* Still have to cover spikes to improve the quality of blender and unity assets being utilized. 
* Sound is a new area to touch upon and will require a few spikes. 
* With the team not going into next semester without all the common classes, communication channels will need an overhaul and meetings will have to be scheduled again. 
* Since the game will now be a side project with all members involved in other courses and new projects, team will have to reassess the time that can be devoted to this project. 
* Efforts and deadlines might be shifted based on the availability of team members so the above schedule will have to be flexible around the final showcase. 
* Controls still don't feel quite right. They need to.
