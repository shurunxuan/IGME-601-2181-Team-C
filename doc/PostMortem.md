## Task Management
 Overall, we had no major problems in this area. Probably could've had more frequent usage of Trello, especially in sprint 3. Work distibrution was satisfactory. We don't think we need to make any major changes/additions to our process in this area.

## Team Communication
 Regular meetings and usage of Slack to communicate was good. In sprint 4, we added a policy for linking pull requests with trello cards. Moving forward, we could consider having less ceremony in our communication since we won't be graded on it.

## Version Control
 We had no major merge conflicts. There were a few minor hiccups, but they were easily resolved. Our usage of GitHub for code reviews was also beneficial to our process. We don't think we need to make any major changes/additions to our process in this area.

## Documentation
 We think we could have more documentation. Our documentation is good, but lacks the breadth and depth of detail to meet industry standards. Moving forward we may use tools to create API documentation.

## Team Organization and Roles
 Roles were rather fluid at times. Fluid roles worked out well and continued usage of our current roles will probably be sufficient moving forward. We don't think we need to make any major changes/additions to our process in this area.

## Retroactive Action Plan Results
 Our test plan got better. Our Trello usage got more consistant. It is hard to evaluate whether or not our usage of story points is better based on two sprints. We will continue to monitor this area moving forward.
