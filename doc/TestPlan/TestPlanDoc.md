# Test Plan Document
This document will propose and record the results of tests used to ensure that acceptance criteria are met. All stories require testing of some sort or another.

## Example
* Camera Tool: PASSED. MD 11/2
  1. Open Assets/Scenes/TestScenes/CameraTestScene.Unity
  2. Use the key: 1 to activate the camera.
  3. Use the key: 1 a second time to record visual info that is in front of the aiming reticle.
  4. Repeat until you have 100% info denoted at the top left corner of the game window. Note that there are three unique instances of visual data as denoted in this test by color. Collecting the same information twice will not increase the amount of info gathered.
